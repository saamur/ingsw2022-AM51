## Requirements
For the implementation of this game, Java 17 was used.
Server and both CLI and GUI Client can run on all operative systems

# How to play using the JAR
There is a single file, both for client and for server.
<br>
## LINUX or WINDOWS
### Server
To start the server, open a terminal and go to the directory in which you have saved the jar file. After doing it, run this command on the Command Prompt:<br>
```sh
java -jar Eriantys-Linux-Windows.jar server
```
After that you can leave the default port, 5555, or select a new one.
The server is now online.
<br>
### Client
To start the client, open a terminal and go to the directory in which you have saved the jar file. After that, run this command on the Command Prompt:<br>
```sh
java -jar Eriantys-Linux-Windows.jar
```
followed by "cli" if you want to play with the CLI, and "gui" or no parameter at all if you prefer to play with the GUI.
<br>

## MAC
### Server 
To start the server, open a terminal and go to the directory in which you have saved the jar file. After doing it, run this command on the Command Prompt:<br>
```sh
java -jar Eriantys-Mac.jar server
```
After that you can leave the default port, 5555, or select a new one.
The server is now online.
<br>
### Client
To start the client, open a terminal and go to the directory in which you have saved the jar file. After that, run this command on the Command Prompt:<br>
```sh
java -jar Eriantys-Mac.jar
```
followed by "cli" if you want to play with the CLI, and "gui" or no parameter at all if you prefer to play with the GUI.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

It is also possible to run the GUI by clicking twice on the jar file.<br>
It is possible to play a game with a minimum of two players and a maximum of three.<br>
The game will create two folders in which it will save the unfinished games that can be reopened in the future.
